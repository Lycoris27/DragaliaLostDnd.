**Grams** was a country that existed on the #Mainlands until is was abruptly destroyed in the middle of the #ThirdDaneWars 
The country overnight was invaded and destroyed by black mana, including the destruction of all natural flora and fauna in the area that could not escape. Now it has become a barren uninhabitable desert holding the name of its previous country.
