The Northern-most country in the world, it snows all-year round and is a very hostile climate requiring specific adaptation to its climate. The denizens of this country's bodies have in most cases adapted to fit the climate, and with this have learned to harness it to their advantage.




A large amount of the denizens are magically attuned to water, with this their bodies can withstand the cold temperatures and when put into warmer temperatures it is found that they  freeze the local area around them without any effort.
